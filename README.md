# DDNS
A repo for automatically updating DNS records for servers with frequently-changing ip addresses. Currently supporting namecheap ONLY!

### A pre-release is currently available under the "releases" section of this github. It does NOT support running at computer startup, nor saving profiles and continuing operation between program launches. Please use cautiously as it is considered alpha (due to missing features).
